<p><strong>Air Pollution In Our Homes</strong>, Wood coal dung kerosene and inefficient technologies. Gas stoves that are not well ventilated with hoods to outside can increase exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are a primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Research features the monitoring and forecasting of wildfire occurrence and distribution.</p>

<p>In Gibraltar however this is not necessarily the case due to our proximity to the refinery industries across the Bay as well as the ship repair yard and proximity of ships bunkering. Our airways and lungs have a number of features that enable them to capture and eliminate many particles that enter the airways. Toxic gases like Nitrogen dioxide NOx Sulphur dioxide SO2 Carbon monoxide CO Ozone O3 etc. The rise of chemicals in our home products is probably why we are seeing the rise of indoor air pollution.</p>

<p>Even as weve worked to reduce our climate and air pollution by cutting down on vehicle use and using clean fossil free sources for our electricity we continue to use fossil fuels like fossil gas still called natural gas by the gas industry to heat and power our homesraising our greenhouse gas emissions and dirtying our air. In fact some studies show that the indoor air quality in our homes could be 2 to 5 times worse than it is outdoors. ABOUT INDOOR AIR CHEMISTRY. Using gas not only damages our health but puts our communities in. In fact recent research by the Environmental Protection Agency estimates the air in our homes can be up to five times more polluted than in big cities.</p>

I t is particularly important to understand levels of pollution in our houses because it is where we tend to spend most of our time so any health effects are likely to be more significant There is some speculation that a lot of the microplastics might be coming from textiles and that their distribution might be affected by ventilation and the age of the building.

<p>During the first phase of the study researchers from the University of Leeds will work with 40 families from Bradford in West Yorkshire to measure the level of microplastics caught in sampling devices placed inside their houses. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough fresh outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home.
