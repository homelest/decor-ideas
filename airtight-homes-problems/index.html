<p><strong>Airtight Homes Problems</strong>, In many ways uncontrolled air movement wastes energy and increases the risk of long-term damage to building components. Airtight homes can overheat become too humid and suffer from mould and a number of indoor air pollutants which harm human health especially in those more vulnerable such as children the elderly and those with respiratory or immunity problems. Today homes are built to be more airtight to help increase energy efficiency. Unventilated ie Victorian homes relying on fresh air from air bricks and cracks and leaks.</p>

<p>Airtightness in homes can lead to. The problem with airtight homes A recent article on the New Zealand Institute of Building Surveyors website says that New Zealand homes have gone from being extremely well-ventilated to potentially too airtight. Airtight homes can overheat become too humid and suffer from mould and a number of indoor air pollutants which harm human health especially in those more vulnerable such as children the elderly and those with respiratory or immunity problems. Your contractor is right about moisture being a potential problem in tight houses but he missed two important points. Airtightness can lead to condensation and mould.</p>
