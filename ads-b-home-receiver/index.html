<p><strong>Ads B Home Receiver</strong>, Over on Imgur and Reddit user Mavericknos has uploaded a very nice pictorial guide where he shows how hes built a high performance RTL-SDR based ADS-B receiver that can be mounted outside in a waterproof enclosure. This information isnt encrypted and anyone can build themselves a receiver to take those transmissions and draw. When enabled the ADS-B library will store information for up to 50 vehicles detected by the ADS-B receiver but can be further limited using the ADSB_LIST_MAX parameter. Stratux is free software that enables DIY and low cost ADS-B receivers for pilots.</p>

<p>He uses a FlightAware dongle which is an RTL-SDR optimized for best ADS-B reception when placed directly at the mastantenna.

Conversely an aircraft can be fitted with an ADS-B receiver processor to display the detected ADS-B transmissions from other aircraft to the pilot. Flightaware Hackaday.</p>
