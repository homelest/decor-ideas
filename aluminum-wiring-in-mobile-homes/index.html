<p>This light gray colored wiring has phased out but you can still find it in old mobile home wiring. Mobile Home electrical systems are designed to the same code and use the same parts as a site built home. Up until the year 1971 all mobile homes had aluminum wiring as it was much cheaper than copper. In general the issues associated with aluminum wiring terminations have been effectively and efficiently dealt with and now aluminum is the predominant wiring method for large feeders and wiring in most buildings nationwide as the cost differential is again of major concern and affects virtually every project.</p>
