<p>The sad truth of it is that many kids who are up for fostering are there because their parents abused them and many foster kids are hugely fucked up. So my point is the situations that get kids put in foster care are terrible. I know bad foster homes are out there but I think how fiercely I love these kids and take care of them it is hard to think of bad homes. Theres no simple answer to that question because every home is different.</p>

<p>However without these selfless individuals the foster care system would cease to function and children who are hurt and scared wouldnt have a chance to have their lives filled with love. Just like no two people in the world are the exact same no foster home will be identical to another. Foster children are not bad They are hurt people often traumatized and have additional struggles because of those things. Unfortunately these myths and misconceptions when promoted by powerful and wealthy advocates can be perpetuated and enshrined into policy. I just feel broken with everything that has recently happened to us as foster parents.</p>

Unfortunately these myths and misconceptions when promoted by powerful and wealthy advocates can be perpetuated and enshrined into policy.
