<p>Single family homes or condominiums exempt under the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act. Most single-family homes are exempt regardless of when they were built. If there is only one unit on the property that is it has no additional unit like an in-law or a cottage the house is considered a single-family dwelling even if isnt occupied by a family under state law and is exempt from rent ceilings and registration requirements. Exempts individuals who own no more than two homes from new rent-control policies. Q A Statewide Rent Control And Single Family Homes.</p>
