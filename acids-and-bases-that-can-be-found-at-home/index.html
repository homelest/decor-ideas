<p>Acids can be found in everyday products like. Bleach ammonia and lyme can also be used as bases but only with an adult and should be diluted a little before the. Other household substances that are acidic include soda carbonic acid fruit ascorbic acid citrus citric acid tea wine tannic acid and grapes tartaric acid. A base that can dissolve in water is also called an alkali.</p>

<p>Most bases are minerals which form water and salts by reacting with acids. Blue and red grapes contain several different pH-sensitive anthocyanins. Here are some examples of bases at home. In the first glass put a little less than 18 teaspoon of sodium carbonate in the second put 6 drops of phenolphthalein solution and in the third put three droppers-full of vinegar. People use it for cooking purposes and this is what gives the salad a delicious taste and pickled vegetables and fruits their- tart taste.</p>
