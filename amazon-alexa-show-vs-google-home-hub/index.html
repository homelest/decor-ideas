<p>Amazons Echo Show has a rounder shape than Googles Nest Hub which looks more like a screen on a stand. The Echo Show 10 is the most expensive model at 250 slightly pricier than the 230 Nest Hub Max followed by the Echo Show 8 at 130. A bigger screen and better speakers come at a cost. Googles voice assistant is better at understanding what you mean without giving a really specific command while Alexa does more.

<p>I have trouble with Alexa at times in my home so I imagine he would have way more problems. The Echo Show 10 is the most expensive model at 250 slightly pricier than the 230 Nest Hub Max followed by the Echo Show 8 at 130. If youre not brand loyal to GoogleNest and plan on piecemailing your devices together with what you find on Amazon then Alexa may be better for you. The Google hubs are also significantly cheaper so thats nice. Facebook Portal Vs Google Home Hub Vs Amazon Echo Show Compared Google Home Best Smart Home Smart Home.</p>
