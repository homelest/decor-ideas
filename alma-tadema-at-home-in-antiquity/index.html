<p>It was guest co-curated by Elizabeth Prettejohn University of York Peter Trippi independent scholar New York and Ivo Blom Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. At Home in Antiquity 7 July 29 October 2017 explores Lawrence Alma-Tademas fascination with the representation of domestic life in antiquity and how this interest related to his own domestic circumstances expressed through the two remarkable studio-houses that he created in St Johns Wood together with his wife Laura and daughters. This important re-evaluation of the Dutch- born painter Lawrence Alma-Tadema traces his personal and artistic journey towards international fame and success in London and investigates how this exceptionally creative artist used his own houses and studios as laboratories to produce vivid paintings of life in ancient Greece Rome and Egypt. From 2003 until 2006 Trippi was director of New York Citys Dahesh Museum of Art which is devoted to 19th- and early 20th-century European academic art.
