<p>Lets say we are adding a second router to the network also let us assume that the IP address of your first router on the network is 19216801 then lets give our second router a 19216802 IP address. Adding a second router immediately provides additional Ethernet ports that provide more devices with wired connectivity without the need for a network switch. It appears the ONT can only directly supply to one router but can I add a switch right after the ONT and run one port to the existing wall plate the router connects to and a second directly to the detached building about 100 of cable. In order to get this working we first need to physically connect the second router to the first routers network.</p>

<p>You can set up two separate internet connections to your single router. The main router should have an active internet connection before cascading the secondary router. I have that plugged via Ethernet from one of the LAN ports on router 1 to on of the LAN ports on router 2. The second router should be Linksys and will be called the secondary router. Having a second router is useful if you have a wired home network but also want to connect some Wi-Fi enabled devices.</p>
