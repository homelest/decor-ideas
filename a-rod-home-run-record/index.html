<p><strong>A Rod Home Run Record</strong>, A-Rod hasnt hit 37 home runs in a season since 2007 so its likely Rodriguez will need more than two seasons to break Bonds record. Alex Rodriguez hits a solo home run to give the Yankees the lead and it marks home run No. A-Rod breaks Willie Mays record with 661st home run.

New York Yankees Third Baseman Alex Rodriguez Rounds The Bases On His Home Run To Left During The Second Inning Against New York Yankees Yankee Stadium Yankees From pinterest.com</p>
<p>He affixed a laser-engraved asterisk and gave the ball to. But you also have to look at Sammy Sosa because in 2007 he hit that unbelievable 600 home run but if you really look at him you know that he is getting old and Rodriguez is only in his 30s so yes A-Rod. Drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 1st round 1st pick of the 1993 amateur draft. Unlike Bonds who took steroids.</p>
