<p><strong>Ai For Smart Home</strong>, The type of AI that is employed in home systems is termed Narrow AI and this type of technology is already used in other areas such as smartphones and search engines. The desire for a more immersive and perceptive human-machine interaction is a key factor driving the need for edge AI in the smart home. Smart living with automation and integrated AI-IoT is no longer considered as a luxury as home automation tools have become more affordable. In the last episode of Predicting our Future a podcast series by Andrew Weinreich he explains how personas will play the central role in developing smart home intelligence.</p>
