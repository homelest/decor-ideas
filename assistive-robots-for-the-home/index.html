<p>We designed the Assistance Preference Checklist to assess participants preferences for human or robot assistance for 48 home-based tasks. We developed the Robot Opinions Questionnaire based upon existing technology acceptance scales Davis 1989 as a general measure of robot acceptance. Developing robots for the home is still a challenge especially if you want those robots to interact with people and help them do practical useful things. We then introduce some design principles and apply these to a simplified case study. Then even if theyre unconscious the device will contact a caregiver.</p>

<p>Introduction Modern assistive technologies help humans to improve their quality of life. The ENRICHME robot was tested in three pilot sites around Europe Poland Greece and UK and proven to be an effective assistant for the elderly at home. At the Human-centered Assistive Robotics group we aim at innovative research on cognitive robot motor skill learning and control based on human motion understanding. The case study was implemented as a concrete illustration and a series of experiments are reported. Ecovacs Robotics Award Winning Robots For Your Home Robot Design Robot High Tech Design.</p>
