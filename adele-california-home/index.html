<p>Adele reportedly shelled out 95 million on her new property which was a steal at 400000 less than the original asking price of 99 million. It also boasts an office which the singer could easily turn into a recording studio. In 2016 Adele bought her first home in Beverly Hills for 95 million. In May the singer paid 10 million for the 5515-square-foot four-bedroom four-bathroom home nearly five years after purchasing her first property in the Hidden Valley community.
