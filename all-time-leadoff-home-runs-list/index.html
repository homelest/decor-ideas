<p>Eddie Yost the all-time leader with 28 opening roundtrippers came from this period playing with the Senators Tigers and Dodgers. For example Bobby Bonds hit 11 leadoff home runs in 1973 which ranks second among National Leaguers in a single season. - Jeff Suppan and Pedro Martinez are tied for the all-time lead in surrendering leadoff dingers with 19 apiece. For the better part of baseball history the leadoff spot in a batting order was reserved for guys like the White Sox shortstop spray hitters who were light on their feet.

<li>Jeff Suppan and Pedro Martinez are tied for the all-time lead in surrendering leadoff dingers with 19 apiece. - A leadoff homer is pretty important to a teams chance of winning. Most lists involving leadoff feats tend to well lead off with Henderson so its no surprise that the Hall of Famer stolen base king and greatest leadoff hitter in history can be found in his usual No. Ranked second on the Padres all-time list behind only Will Venable. New York Yankees Rickey Henderson Sets The Leadoff Home Run Record.</li>
