<p>Nancy Hatfield daughter of Devil Anse who was known as Nannie died about 30 years before I was born so sadly I never knew her. Some sources maintain the desertions occurred because the 45 th Battalion had been ordered to move out of the area and the men were not willing to leave their homes unprotected from bushwhackers. In the late 1870s Devil Anse Hatfield got into a land dispute with McCoys cousin Perry Cline. His family and Randolph McCoys fought in one of the bloodiest and most well-known feuds in American history. Pin On West Virginia.</p>
