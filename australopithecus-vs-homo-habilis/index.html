<p>Foraging strategies of hominids were not dramatically different. Male australopithecines were larger in body size. Homo habilis had reduced jaw made tools like stone flakes and were omnivorous.

<p>Australopithecus africanus was nearly identical in body and brain size to A. The evolutionary scientists believe suddenly australopith species became a Homo genus like Homo habilis two million years ago in Africa and eventually the modern humans Homo sapiens came into being. The first species to be identified as Australopithecus received that name in 1925 and after nearly a century of discoveries paleoanthropologists are able draw upon a fairly rich storehouse of fossil hominin specimens from Africa. Summary Homo Habilis was a hominid presumed to be an intermediate animal crossing between the genus Australopithecus and Homo. Erectus is more dimorphic than H.</p>
