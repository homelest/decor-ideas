<p>A detached garage sits. To connect the additions roof to the home if the addition is lower than the roof on your home you will need to use flashing to seal the gap between the home and the addition. But as stated above HUD does not regulate any additions to the home after it has been delivered and set up. If adding a built-in garage expect the costs to be that of an attached garage with living space above 60000 to 65000 plus the added expense of creating an access point from the garage to the house and from the house to living space above the garage which will add at least another 1000.
