<p>Unfortunately home improvements are not always tax deductible because the IRS considers them personal expenditures. So if you made a home improvement back in 2007 and sold your house during 2018 any deductions you may be eligible for would be recognized on your 2018 taxes. The IRS states that energy saving improvements made to a personal dwelling before January 1 2020 qualify for the credit which is equal to 30 of the cost of the equipment. Unfortunately for the most part home improvements are not tax-deductible. 6 Tax Deductible Home Improvement Repairs For 2021 Walletgenius.</p>
